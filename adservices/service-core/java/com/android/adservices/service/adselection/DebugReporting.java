/**
 * Event-level debug reporting for ad selection.
 *
 * <p>Protected Audience debug reporting allows ad tech developers to declare remote URLs to receive
 * a GET request from devices when an auction is won / lost. This allows the following use-cases:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>See if auctions are being won / lost
 *   <li>Understand why auctions are being lost (e.g. understand if itâ€™s an issue with a bidding /
 *       scoring script implementation or a core logic issue)
 *   <li>Monitor roll-outs of new JavaScript logic to clients
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Debug reporting consists of two JS APIs available for usage, both of which take a URL string:
 * <li>forDebuggingOnly.reportAdAuctionWin(String url)
 * <li>forDebuggingOnly.reportAdAuctionWin(String url)
 *
 *     <p>For the classes that wrap JavaScript code, see {@link DebugReportingScriptStrategy}.
 *     <p>For the classes that send events, see {@link DebugReportSenderStrategy}.
 *     <p>For the business logic processing events, see {@link DebugReportProcessor}.
